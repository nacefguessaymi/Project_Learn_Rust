// Ok I can get behind this tbh
// I like this double slash comment structure

fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
    //Weird syntax for prints but what can i say
    //does it handle multiple print lines?
    println!("Second test line");
    // Ok so it seems like every action within a function needs to end with ;
    // Mistakes made lessons learned
}
